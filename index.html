  <br />Clearly, the final product was quite different from what was conceptualized.<br />
  I got the idea for the pipe being a blood vessel from the first Milestone which gave me a pretty solid narrative to work on.
  
  
  <h4> Thoughts on Unity, Chuck and Chunity </h4>
  It was pretty great working with Unity since I could come up with some complex looking stuff in a matter of few hours rather than days it would have taken me in OpenGL.<br />
  However, I wonder how different would people's projects be if we'd started using Unity from assignment 1. Personally, I would have been willing to experiment more if I had more experience with Unity.
  
  Chunity was pretty awesome too! If there's some way to add multiple Chuck Instances without the sound degrading, that'd be great :)
